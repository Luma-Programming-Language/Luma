Changelog for Bugfix Release (v0.1.6)

Fixes:

Resolved an issue where struct functions were not being called correctly from modules.

Corrected static analyzer behavior to only track pointer returns from #returns_ownership functions, preventing false positive memory leak warnings for structs with pointer fields.

Minor fixes for 2D matrix byte access on very large inputs.

Other Updates:

Updated README for clarity.

Added arena library and vector library.

Improved LSP support: correct path resolution for standard library files, better code completion, and added string_add function to the standard library.

Notes:

Static memory ownership tracking enhancements remain, including improved detection for memory leaks, double-free, and use-after-free within function scope.

Known limitations: struct field allocations tracked at the struct level; conditional allocation paths may still produce false positives; array-of-pointers patterns not fully tracked.
